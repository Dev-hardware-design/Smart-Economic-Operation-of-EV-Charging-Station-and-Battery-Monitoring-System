# Smart-Economic-Operation-of-EV-Charging-Station-and-Battery-Monitoring-System
hi guys,

**Overview of the Project** : This project smart economic operation system for EV charging stations using RFID-based authentication and IoT-
enabled remote monitoring. Integrated sensors to track battery health, state of charge, power, and temperature,
ensuring efficient charging and improved battery lifespan. Enhanced security and user experience by preventing
unethical unplugging and optimizing operational costs, promoting wider EV adoption.
